MMFeedbacks v1.6

## WHAT'S IN THE ASSET ?
-------------------------

The MMFeedbacks asset contains the following folders : 
- MMFeedbacks : all you need to add custom feedbacks with only a few clicks, including MMFeedbacksForThirdParty : more feedbacks, but these have dependencies (PostProcessing, Cinemachine, Nice Vibrations...). 
- MMTools : a set of tools and helpers
- NiceVibrations : the NiceVibrations package, exactly the same as https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/nice-vibrations-108559?aid=1011lKhG&utm_source=aff, offered as a gift


## HOW DO I ADD THIS TO MY GAME ?
------------------------------

You should probably go check out http://feedbacks-docs.moremountains.com/, there'll be more details, but basically all you need is to import the asset into your project, and you can start having fun with feedbacks. Looking at the demo might be a good starting point.

## IS THERE DOCUMENTATION SOMEWHERE ?
-------------------------------------

There is!
There's a functional documentation at http://feedbacks-docs.moremountains.com/
And a complete API documentation at http://feedbacks-docs.moremountains.com/API/
